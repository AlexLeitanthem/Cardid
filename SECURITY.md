## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Security Considerations

### Input Validation
- All input is validated for NULL pointers and buffer bounds
- Buffer overflow protection is implemented
- Output buffers are initialized to prevent information leakage
- Input length is strictly validated (13-19 digits)

### Memory Safety
- No dynamic memory allocation
- Stack-based buffers with fixed maximum sizes
- Buffer initialization prevents data leakage
- Bounds checking on all array accesses

### Data Handling
- No sensitive data is stored or logged
- Card numbers are processed in-memory only
- No network communication or external data storage
- No persistent storage of card data

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email security details to: [security@example.com]
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### Response Timeline
- Initial response: 48 hours
- Status update: 7 days
- Resolution: 30 days (depending on complexity)

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers
- Always validate input parameters
- Use the provided API functions rather than direct manipulation
- Never log or store card numbers
- Use the library in a secure environment

### For Users
- Never store card numbers in plain text
- Use HTTPS for any web interfaces
- Implement proper access controls
- Follow PCI DSS guidelines for production use
